          <p>
            Hi, I'm Pascal "Pasu" Stockert - a web developer based in Leipzig, Germany!{'\n'}
            While I love to explore all aspects behind web-apps I mostly dabble with shapes and colors.
          </p>

          <p>
            As everyone and their mother has a blog nowadays, why not start my own?{'\n'}
            Look forward to the usual stuff - (somewhat) useful code snippets, (barely) exciting stories from my
            life and insights into my work (very original).
          </p>

          <p>
            As I'm fairly new to writing, please don't expect all toooo frequent uploads.{'\n'}
            Let's pretend I'm going for quality over quantity!
          </p>

          <h2>My latest posts</h2>

          {/*<div className="post-preview"></div>*/}

          {/*<a href="pages/post.html"
             className="paragraph text-right load-on-propagate">Show all</a>*/}

        </div>

      </div>
