# Hello ðŸ‘‹
This is a blog implemented with Next.js using Notion as a "headless CMS", hosted on Vercel.
I started this project to find my way into the framework itself as well as react.

## Usage
If you want to use any part of this project for your own works, feel free to!

You can also fork and deploy the project to start your own blog - this however will
take you some setting up. Contact me on Discord (Pasu#3669) in case you wish to do this.
